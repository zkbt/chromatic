    Create a shared 1D wavelength axis that tries to compress
    different wavelength axes associated with different times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wscale : str
        What kind of a new wavelength axis should be created?
        Options include:
            'linear' = constant d[wavelength] between grid points
            'log' = constant d[wavelength]/[wavelength] between grid points
            'nonlinear' = the median wavelength grid for all time points

    supersampling : float
        By how many times should we increase or decrease the wavelength sampling?
        In general, values >1 will split each input wavelength grid point into
        multiple supersampled wavelength grid points, values close to 1 will
        produce approximately one output wavelength for each input wavelength,
        and values <1 will average multiple input wavelengths into a single output
        wavelength bin.

        Unless this is significantly less than 1, there's a good chance your output
        array may have strong correlations between one or more adjacent wavelengths.
        Be careful when trying to use the resulting uncertainties!

        (FIXME = add a way to estimate a covariance matrix when binning?)

    visualize : bool
        Should we make some plots showing how the shared wavelength
        axis compares to the original input wavelength axes?

    """
    Use 2D wavelength information to align onto a single 1D wavelength array.

    This relies on the existence of a `.fluxlike['wavelength_2d']` array,
    expressing the wavelength associated with each flux element.
    Those wavelengths will be used to (a) establish a new compromise
    wavelength grid and (b) bin the individual timepoints onto that
    new grid, effectively shifting the wavelengths to align.

    Parameters
    ----------
    minimum_acceptable_ok : float, optional
        The numbers in the `.ok` attribute express "how OK?" each
        data point is, ranging from 0 (not OK) to 1 (super OK).
        In most cases, `.ok` will be binary, but there may be times
        where it's intermediate (for example, if a bin was created
        from some data that were not OK and some that were).
        The `minimum_acceptable_ok` parameter allows you to specify what
        level of OK-ness for a point to go into the binning.
        Reasonable options may include:
            minimum_acceptable_ok = 1
                  Only data points that are perfectly OK
                  will go into the binning. All other points
                  will effectively be interpolated over. Flux
                  uncertainties *should* be inflated appropriately,
                  but it's very possible to create correlated
                  bins next to each other if many of your ingoing
                  data points are not perfectly OK.
            minimum_acceptable_ok = 1
                  All data points that aren't definitely not OK
                  will go into the binning. The OK-ness of points
                  will propagate onward for future binning.
            minimum_acceptable_ok < 0
                  All data points will be included in the bin.
                  The OK-ness will propagate onward.
    wscale : str, optional
        What kind of a new wavelength axis should be created?
        Options include:
            'linear' = constant d[wavelength] between grid points
            'log' = constant d[wavelength]/[wavelength] between grid points
            'nonlinear' = the median wavelength grid for all time points
    supersampling : float, optional
        By how many times should we increase or decrease the wavelength sampling?
        In general, values >1 will split each input wavelength grid point into
        multiple supersampled wavelength grid points, values close to 1 will
        produce approximately one output wavelength for each input wavelength,
        and values <1 will average multiple input wavelengths into a single output
        wavelength bin.
        Unless this is significantly less than 1, there's a good chance your output
        array may have strong correlations between one or more adjacent wavelengths.
        Be careful when trying to use the resulting uncertainties!

        axis compares to the original input wavelength axes?
