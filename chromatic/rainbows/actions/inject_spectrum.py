    Inject a stellar spectrum into the flux.

    This injects a constant stellar spectrum into
    all times in the `Rainbow`. Injection happens
    by multiplying the `.model` flux array, so for
    example a model that already has a transit in
    it will be scaled up to match the stellar spectrum
    in all wavelengths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    temperature : Quantity, optional
        Temperature, in K (with no astropy units attached).
    logg : float, optional
        Surface gravity log10[g/(cm/s**2)] (with no astropy units attached).
    metallicity : float, optional
        Metallicity log10[metals/solar] (with no astropy units attached).
    radius : Quantity, optional
        The radius of the star.
    distance : Quantity, optional
        The distance to the star.
    phoenix : bool, optional
        If `True`, use PHOENIX surface flux.
        If `False`, use Planck surface flux.

    Returns
    -------
    rainbow : Rainbow
        A new `Rainbow` object with the spectrum injected.
