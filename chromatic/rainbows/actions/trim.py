    Trim in time.

    This removes times that either (a) fall outside of a desired time range
    or (b) are mostly useless.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t_min : u.Quantity
        The minimum time to keep.
    t_max : u.Quantity
        The maximum time to keep.
    just_edges : bool, optional
        Should we only trim the outermost bad time bins?
            `True` = Just trim off the bad edges and keep
            interior bad values. Keeping interior data, even if
            they're all bad, often helps to make for more
            intuititive imshow plots.
            `False` = Trim off every bad time, whether it's on
            the edge or somewhere in the middle of the dataset.
            The resulting Rainbow will be smaller, but it might
            be a little tricky to visualize with imshow.
    when_to_give_up : float, optional
        The fraction of wavelengths that must be nan or not OK
        for the entire time to be considered bad (default = 1).
            `1.0` = trim only if all wavelengths are bad
            `0.5` = trim if more than 50% of wavelengths are bad
            `0.0` = trim if any wavelengths are bad
    minimum_acceptable_ok : float, optional
        The numbers in the `.ok` attribute express "how OK?" each
        data point is, ranging from 0 (not OK) to 1 (super OK).
        In most cases, `.ok` will be binary, but there may be times
        where it's intermediate (for example, if a bin was created
        from some data that were not OK and some that were).
        The `minimum_acceptable_ok` parameter allows you to specify what
        level of OK-ness for a point to not get trimmed.

    Returns
    -------
    trimmed : Rainbow
        The trimmed `Rainbow`.

    Trim away bad wavelengths and/or times.

    and visualizations. This function will trim those away,

    to maintain a contiguous block.
