    with them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : array
        The effective number of original bins going into each new bin.
    minimum_points_per_bin : float
        The threshold for the number of original bins to not be enough.

        Of the {len(N_not_edges)} non-edge new {dimension} bins,
        {fraction_that_are_bad:.1%} of them effectively contain fewer
        than one original {dimension}.

        Here are your options:
        1) Rerun you binning with larger {dimension} bin sizes to
        decrease the chances that they will be partially populated.
        2) Rerun your binning but change `minimum_points_per_bin=` to a number.
        This will set a lower limit on the effective number of inputs
        points required for each bin. Bins that don't meet this limit
        will be marked as not `ok`, and if `trim=True` (default)
        these bins will automatically be trimmed away. A threshold
        of 1 means bins should average together one or more input
        data; a threshold of 0 will get rid of this warning but
        allow many bins to come from the same data point, so you
        should expect weird correlations.

    """
    Bin in wavelength and/or time.

    Average together some number of adjacent data points,
    in wavelength and/or time. For well-behaved data where
    data points are independent from each other, binning down
    by N data points should decrease the noise per bin by
    approximately 1/sqrt(N), making it easier to see subtle
    signals. To bin data points together, data are combined
    using inverse-variance weighting through interpolation
    of cumulative distributions, in an attempt to make sure
    that flux integrals between limits are maintained.

    Currently, the inverse-variance weighting is most reliable
    only for datasets that have been normalized to be close
    to 1. We still need to do a little work to make sure
    it works well on unnormalized datasets with dramatically
    non-uniform uncertainties.

    By default, time binning happens before wavelength binning.
    To control the order, use separate calls to `.bin()`.

    The time-setting order of precendence is
    [`time_edges`, `time`, `dt`, `ntimes`]
    The first will be used, and others will be ignored.

    The wavelength-setting order of precendence is
    [`wavelength_edges`, `wavelength`, `dw`, `R`, `nwavelengths`]
    The first will be used, and others will be ignored.


    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : Quantity
        The d(time) bin size for creating a grid
        that is uniform in linear space.
    time : Quantity
        An array of times, if you just want to give
        it an entirely custom array.
        The widths of the bins will be guessed from the centers
        (well, if the spacing is uniform constant; pretty well
        but not perfectly otherwise).
    time_edges : Quantity
        An array of times for the edges of bins,
        if you just want to give an entirely custom array.
        The bins will span `time_edges[:-1]` to
        `time_edges[1:]`, so the resulting binned
        Rainbow will have `len(time_edges) - 1`
        time bins associated with it.
    ntimes : int
        A fixed number of time to bin together.
        Binning will start from the 0th element of the
        starting times; if you want to start from
        a different index, trim before binning.
    R : float
        The spectral resolution for creating a grid
        that is uniform in logarithmic space.
    dw : Quantity
        The d(wavelength) bin size for creating a grid
        that is uniform in linear space.
    wavelength : Quantity
        An array of wavelengths for the centers of bins,
        if you just want to give an entirely custom array.
        The widths of the bins will be guessed from the centers
        (well, if the spacing is uniform constant; pretty well
        but not perfectly otherwise).
    wavelength_edges : Quantity
        An array of wavelengths for the edges of bins,
        if you just want to give an entirely custom array.
        The bins will span `wavelength_edges[:-1]` to
        `wavelength_edges[1:]`, so the resulting binned
        Rainbow will have `len(wavelength_edges) - 1`
        wavelength bins associated with it.
    nwavelengths : int
        A fixed number of wavelengths to bin together.
        Binning will start from the 0th element of the
        starting wavelengths; if you want to start from
        a different index, trim before binning.
    minimum_acceptable_ok : float
        The numbers in the `.ok` attribute express "how OK?" each
        data point is, ranging from 0 (not OK) to 1 (super OK).
        In most cases, `.ok` will be binary, but there may be times
        where it's intermediate (for example, if a bin was created
        from some data that were not OK and some that were).
        The `minimum_acceptable_ok` parameter allows you to specify what
        level of OK-ness for a point to go into the binning.
        Reasonable options may include:
            minimum_acceptable_ok = 1
                  Only data points that are perfectly OK
                  will go into the binning.
            minimum_acceptable_ok = 1e-10
                  All data points that aren't definitely not OK
                  will go into the binning.
            minimum_acceptable_ok = 0
                  All data points will be included in the bin.
    minimum_points_per_bin : float
        If you're creating bins that are smaller than those in
        the original dataset, it's possible to end up with bins
        that effectively contain fewer than one original datapoint
        (in the sense that the contribution of one original datapoint
        might be split across multiple new bins). By default,
        we allow this behavior with `minimum_points_per_bin=0`, but you can
        limit your result to only bins that contain one or more
        original datapoints with `minimum_points_per_bin=1`.
    trim : bool
        Should any wavelengths or columns that end up
        as entirely nan be trimmed out of the result?
        (default = True)

        It looks like you're trying to bin in wavelength for a
        `Rainbow` object that might not be normalized. In the
        current version of `chromatic`, binning before normalizing
        might give inaccurate results if the typical uncertainty
        varies strongly with wavelength.

        Please consider normalizing first, for example with
        `rainbow.normalize().bin(...)`
        so that all uncertainties will effectively be relative,
        and the inverse variance weighting used for binning
        wavelengths together will give more reasonable answers.

        If you really need to bin before normalizing, please submit
        an Issue at github.com/zkbt/chromatic/, and we'll try to
        prioritize implementing a statistically sound solution as
        soon as possible!
