class Rainbow:
    """
    `Rainbow` (ðŸŒˆ) objects represent brightness as a function
    of both wavelength and time.

    These objects are useful for reading or writing multiwavelength
    time-series datasets in a variety of formats, visualizing these
    data with simple commands, and performing basic calculations.
    `RainbowWithModel` and `SimulatedRainbow` objects inherit from
    `Rainbow`, so all basically all methods and attributes described
    below are available for them too.

    Attributes

    wavelike : dict
        A dictionary for quantities with shape `(nwave,),
        for which there's one value for each wavelength.

        for which there's one value for each time.
    fluxlike : dict

        for which there's one value for each wavelength and time.

        Initialize a `Rainbow` object.

        The `__init__` function is called when a new `Rainbow` is
        instantiated as `r = Rainbow(some, kinds, of=inputs)`.

        The options for inputs are flexible, including the possibility
        to initialize from a file, from arrays with appropriate units,
        from dictionaries with appropriate ingredients, or simply as
        an empty object if no arguments are given.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filepath : str, optional
            The filepath pointing to the file or group of files
            that should be read.
        format : str, optional
            The file format of the file to be read. If None,
            the format will be guessed automatically from the
            filepath.
        wavelength : Quantity, optional
            A 1D array of wavelengths, in any unit.
        time : Quantity, Time, optional
            A 1D array of times, in any unit.
        flux : array, optional
            A 2D array of flux values.
        uncertainty : array, optional
            A 2D array of uncertainties, associated with the flux.
        wavelike : dict, optional
            A dictionary containing 1D arrays with the same
            shape as the wavelength axis. It must at least
            contain the key 'wavelength', which should have
            astropy units of wavelength associated with it.
        timelike : dict, optional
            A dictionary containing 1D arrays with the same
            shape as the time axis. It must at least
            contain the key 'time', which should have
            astropy units of time associated with it.
        fluxlike : dict, optional
            A dictionary containing 2D arrays with the shape
            of (nwave, ntime), like flux. It must at least
            contain the key 'flux'.
        metadata : dict, optional
            A dictionary containing all other metadata
            associated with the dataset, generally lots of
            individual parameters or comments.
        **kw : dict, optional
            Additional keywords will be passed along to
            the function that initializes the rainbow.
            If initializing from arrays (`time=`, `wavelength=`,
            ...), these keywords will be interpreted as
            additional arrays that should be sorted by their
            shape into the appropriate dictionary. If
            initializing from files, the keywords will
            be passed on to the reader.

        Examples
        --------
        Initialize from a file. While this works, a more robust
        solution is probably to use `read_rainbow`, which will
        automatically choose the best of `Rainbow` and `RainbowWithModel`
        ```
        r1 = Rainbow('my-neat-file.abc', format='abcdefgh')
        ```

        Initalize from arrays. The wavelength and time must have
        appropriate units, and the shape of the flux array must
        match the size of the wavelength and time arrays. Other
        arrays that match the shape of any of these quantities
        will be stored in the appropriate location. Other inputs
        not matching any of these will be stored as `metadata.`
        ```
        r2 = Rainbow(
                wavelength=np.linspace(1, 5, 50)*u.micron,
                time=np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 100)*u.day,
                flux=np.random.normal(0, 1, (50, 100)),
                some_other_array=np.ones((50,100)),
                some_metadata='wow!'
        )
        ```
        Initialize from dictionaries. The dictionaries must contain
        at least `wavelike['wavelength']`, `timelike['time']`, and
        `fluxlike['flux']`, but any other additional inputs can be
        provided.
        ```
