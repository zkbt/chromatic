However, if you more closely at what's happening inside a `Rainbow` object, you'll see that these are properties that pull data from some core dictionaries. The general user probably doesn't need to interact with the core dictionaries, but if you're developing new features for `Rainbow` objects you will want to understand what's happening a little more clearly.\n",

    "- `.wavelike[...]` contains everything that has the same dimensions as `wavelength`. This dictionary will contain at least a `'wavelength'` key, with the actual wavelengths themselves. It might *also* contain information like the average spectrum of the star, the average S/N at each wavelength, the number of original detector pixels that wound up in this particular wavelength bin, and/or a mask of what wavelengths should be considered good or bad (no matter the time point). \n",
    "- `.timelike[...]` contains everything that has the same dimensons as `time`. This dictionary will contain at least a `'time'` key, with the actual times themselves. It might *also* contain information like a broadband light curve of the transit, the x or y position of the spectrum on the detector, the temperature of the detector, and/or a mask of what times should be considered good or bad (no matter the wavelength).\n",
    "- `.fluxlike[...]` contains everything that has the same dimensons as `flux`. This dictionary will contain at least a `'flux'` key, with the actual fluxes themselves. It should also contain an `'uncertainty'` keyword with the uncertainties associated with those fluxes (or maybe `None`). It might *also* contain information about other quantities that depend on both time and wavelength, such as the centroid of the spectral trace, the maximum fraction of saturation, and/or a mask of what individual points should be considered good or bad.\n",

    "## How do we add new abilities to `Rainbow` objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add a new method to a `Rainbow` object, there are a few general steps you'll probably want to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install in development mode (see [Installation](../installation)), so you can modify the code package directly and test the code in place.\n",
    "1. Decide a category of \"things a `Rainbow` can do\" in which it belongs.\n",
    "1. Find the directory for that category in the `chromatic` code package. For example, \"actions\" that return new `Rainbow` objects will be in `chromatic/rainbows/actions/`. \n",
    "1. Look at another example in that directory to get a sense for the general layout. For example, you'll notice that \"actions\" generally create a copy of `self`, make some changes to that copy, and then return it as the new object. \n",
    "1. Add your new function, either to an existing `.py` file where it would make sense or to its own new `.py` file. The first argument to your function should be `self`, which is the `Rainbow` object itself, and then any additional arguments should follow afterward. A good way to test out your new function in a notebook or a small isolated script might look something like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from chromatic import *\n",
    "r = SimulatedRainbow().inject_noise()\n",
    "def snazzy_new_action(self, x=2):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # create a copy of the original object\n",
    "    new = self._create_copy()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "    new.fluxlike['flux'] = new.flux**x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # return the modified copy\n",
    "    return new\n",
    "output = snazzy_new_action(r)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows you to develop and test your new function without having to worry about it being imported properly into the core `Rainbow` definition. \n",
    "1. Connect your new function into the `Rainbow` class definition. Normally, we might define a new method directly in the same file as the class definition itself, but we wanted to split the method definitions into multiple files and directories, to make things easier to find. Importing your new function to become a `Rainbow` method takes a few steps. For example, let's imagine you're making a new \"action\" called `snazzy_new_action` and it's located in `chromatic/rainbows/actions/snazzy.py`:\n",
    "    - In `rainbows/actions/snazzy.py`, include line of code like `__all__ = ['snazzy_new_action']` at the top. The `__all__` list defines what would get imported via a line like `from chromatic.rainbows.actions.snazzy import *` (things not in `__all__` will need to be explicitly imported). \n",
    "    - In `rainbows/actions/__init__.py`, include a line of code like `from .snazzy import *`, so that imports from `chromatic.rainbows.actions` will know how to find things in `snazzy.py`. \n",
    "    - In `rainbows/rainbow.py`, down at the very bottom of the class definition for `Rainbow`, add `snazzy_new_action` to the list of `from .actions import (...)`. This, finally, will mean that all `Rainbow` objects will have access to your new method, and we can do things like `r.snazzy_new_action()` from any `Rainbow`.\n",
    "    - In `rainbows/actions/descriptions.txt`, add a row describing your snazzy new action. This table defines what appears in the `.help()` method.\n",
    "1. Write a test for your new feature. This is a function that somehow tests whether your new feature works; the simplest form would be \"does this function run\", a slightly fancier version would be \"are its outputs accurate.\" To write a test:\n",
    "    - Look in `chromatic/tests/` to find a bunch of `test_*.py` files with examples of automated tests in them. \n",
    "    - Create a function that has `*test*` somewhere in its name and store it somewhere in the `tests` directory. At a minimum, this function should test that the bit of code you wrote runs without breaking. \n",
    "    - Run `pytest` from the command line within the main repository directory. This will run your test function (along with all the other tests) and tell you whether it passed or failed. Make sure it passes!"
