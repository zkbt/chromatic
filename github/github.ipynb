You tried out `chromatic` and maybe thought it had some neat features, but you encountered something that didn't work quite how you expected it to, a question that you couldn't find an answer to in the documentation, or a feature that you wished existed. Those would all be great motivations to go to the `chromatic` GitHub repository to [submit an Issue](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/issues)!\n",

I'm sure I'm the only one having this problem or with this question about how `chromatic` works. My idea probably matters only to me and not anyone else. I don't want to make more workf for other folks.\" You're wringing your hands and anxiously worrying about about whether to [submit an Issue](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/issues).\n",

Your experience and curiosity and creativity would be extremely valuable contributions to the package, and make it better for everyone. It's super exciting to hear that someone new else trying to use this code package, and every bit of discussion about how to improve it is super helpful. I promise we're very friendly! So, please, hop on over and [submit an Issue](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/issues)!"

    "## How do we contribute new code? \n",

    "Because we have more than one person working on `chromatic` code, let's please use separate `git` [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for developing new features. Using branches allows us to write code in parallel and merge it together later, without constantly having to make sure that everything everybody writes is up-to-date everywhere all at once. We're generally trying to follow something like the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), to allow us to make changes to the shared code that are a little bit buffered from the published code used by non-developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "There three branches you should know about, and only two you should probably interact with:\n",
    "- The `main` branch hosts the published version of the code for public users. New `pip` versions of the code will be released from the `main` branch. Most developers should never interact directly with the `main` branch.\n",
    "- The `develop` branch is the active branch for shared development. New feature branches should be created from the `develop` branch and once they're reviewed be merged back into `develop`. Occasionally, and only after careful testing and documentation edits, the `develop` branch will get merged into the `main` branch and published to `pip`. \n",
    "- Your `add-amazing-awesome-new-feature` branch (where you replace the name with something more specific and informative) is a temporary branch that you created off of `develop` to add your amazing awesome new feature. You should make your changes and commits to that branch, and when you're ready to discuss to your contribution (either as a draft or a mostly finished product), you should submit a Pull Request from this feature branch into the `develop` branch. Features should be tested well enough that they won't break `develop` when they get merged into it (but if they do, possibly due to a temporary conflict with another feature branch, it's OK because the `main` branch is still safe). Once it's merged, your feature branch will be deleted, and you can start a new one to add a different new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these branches, here's what writing some new code for `chromatic` might look like for you. The following describes using `git` from the Terminal prompt. In practice, you might interact with `git` mostly through [atom](https://atom.io/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or some other tool.\n",
    "1. Discuss your plans in an [Issue](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/issues). You might start from trying to address an existing issue, or you might add a new issue of your own. Either way, it's really helpful to let other folks know \"here's what I'm trying to do\" to avoid duplicate or unfocused efforts. If you're not already a Collaborator on the `chromatic` repository, we can add you at this point!\n",
    "1. Use the [Installation](../installation) instructions to compelete the Developer Installation. This will download the `develop` branch of the `chromatic` repository onto your computer and set up your environment to point to the repository's directory. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic.git\n",
    "cd chromatic\n",
    "pip install -e '.[develop]'\n",

    "git checkout develop\n",
    "git branch add-amazing-awesome-new-feature\n",
    "git checkout add-amazing-awesome-new-feature\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Write your code. Follow some of the tips for [Designing New ðŸŒˆ Features](../designing) to get started, to make sure it imports correctly, and to write some useful tests. Once you've saved some changes to the code, commit those changes to your feature branch. (You can confirm you're on your feature branch by running `git branch` and seeing which branch has the `*`.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"{include informative commit message here}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Up to this point, whatever changes you have committed are still only stored on your computer.\n",
    "1. To start sharing your new code, push your branch up to GitHub. The first time you run this push command, you'll probably get some instructions about how to link your local branch to a new remote one that you're about to create; follow them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now your branch and most recently pushed commits should appear in the GitHub [list of branches](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/branches). \n",
    "1. To ask for your code to be reviewed, either because you think it's finished or because you've completed enough of a draft to be useful to start discussing, submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/zkbt/chromatic/pulls) asking us to pull the code from your feature branch into `develop`. We'll probably discuss a few aspects of it and suggest some changes, which can be implemented by continuing to push new commits to your feature branch as long as the Pull Request is still open. Once it's tested and works and we're all happy with it, we'll merge the code into `develop`, from where it will eventually then be merged into the `main` branch and released in the latest `pip` version.\n",
