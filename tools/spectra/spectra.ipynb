    "# Retrieving Model Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we want to know the spectrum of light emanating from the surface of a star, a planet, or some other object. For `chromatic`, we added a wrapper around the Husser et al. (2013) [library of high-resolution stellar spectra](http://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/) to make it easier to retrieve model spectra at a variety of resolutions. The tools used to achieve this is the `get_phoenix_photons` function, as demonstrated below."

Different resolutions are stored in different files that are loaded as needed. Your code will run a lot faster if you load the lowest resolution that will meet your needs. For a single metallicity, files range from a very manageable 400 kilobytes for $R=10$ to an annoyingling large 3 gigabytes for $R=100000$. Trying to calculate an extremely high resolution model pre-existing metallicity grid point will try to load in all metallicities, which can cause slow-downs because of memory issues. "

The flux returned by `get_phoenix_photons` is a surface flux, in the sense that it represents the rate of photons flowing out of a star's photosphere per unit area. To show how this might be used, the following example calculation integrates a model spectrum to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the Sun. "
