Continually saying or typing ‚Äúspectroscopic light curve‚Äù can get tiring, so we chose \"rainbow\" as a shorter name that is a little nicer to say/type. Also, every emphemeral üåà in nature is itself an expression of brightness as a function of wavelength and of time, so it hopefully kind of makes sense as a name?"
